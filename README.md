# Cesium XR Interview Project

This project is created using Unity3D. (Version: 2019.4.3f1 LTS)

# Overview

For this project, we would like you to develop an XR application for viewing terrain data. You
may use any framework or library you already have experience in. The final deliverables will be:

	1. The source code (can be a link to a repository)
	2. Instructions on how we can run the app
	3. A video capture showing your application running on an XR device

You should deploy your application to an XR device of your choice, whether itâ€™s a VR headset or
a smartphone with AR capabilities. Alternatively, submit a project that emulates the interface of
an XR device.


# Data

Use the included terrain data to create your app.
	Mesh: XR 3D Software Developer - Terrain.glb
	Albedo: XR 3D Software Developer - Albedo.png


# Goal

The objective of this project is to make the terrain easy to explore in XR. For example, a user
may wish to see a particular section of the terrain close up, or they may want to look at the
entire landscape as a whole. They may even want to get all the way down to ground level and
feel as though they are walking on the terrain. Your goal is to achieve this with an intuitive
control scheme that takes advantage of the capabilities of XR.

You are free to implement additional features if you like, but this is not required. Some examples
of other user stories you could work on are:

	1. The user can see information about the terrain, e.g., slope, height.
	2. The user can put elements on the terrain, e.g., markers, vehicles.
	3. The user can see a cross-section of the terrain, e.g., clipping plane.
	4. The user can get a guided tour of the terrain, e.g., flythrough, points of interest.
